# StacksQueuesFileReader
A program that uses stacks and queues to conduct operations on text files. 
This program utilizes the methods associated with stacks and queues to store data read from a text file and then write that data to another text file.

This program can preform three functions wtih a file: reverse, convert, and compare.
Reverse:    The program will read from the text file and print the contents in reverse order to a new text file.
Convert:    The program will read from the text file and print the contents in uppercase to a new text file.
Compare:    The program will read from two files and determine if the contents are equal.

To run, run Main.java after compiling the code together. Make sure all .java files are in the same directory. 

Make sure the text files you select for input are in the same directory as the Java files.
